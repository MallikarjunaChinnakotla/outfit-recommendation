# Abstract

The fashion industry is increasingly leveraging deep learning to automate outfit	classification	and	personalized	recommendation	systems.	This	project presents a complete fashion outfit classification system based on user-defined parameters such as event type, gender, skin tone, and outfit type.

A curated dataset comprising 732 unique images was developed, covering 8 distinct event categories,2gender types, and 3 skin tones. The dataset includes 13 different outfit types for females and 11 outfit types for males, with multiple pose variations to enhance diversity and robustness.The EfficientNetB3 architecture was employed to build and	train	a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the task of outfit classification.The model successfully learned to differentiate between various event types, gender categories, skin tones, and outfit types, achieving high classification accuracy.

The	project	was	 deployed	using	Streamlit,	providing			a		simple		and interactive web application where users can input their preferences and view suitable outfit recommendations generated by the trained model. The system demonstrates	a		practical		application		of		deep	learning	for			structured	outfit classification		and		recommendation.		Future	enhancements		may			include expanding	 the		dataset,	improving		classification		accuracy,	and	incorporating advanced visualization features to enhance user engagement.# outfit-recommendation
